        <aside>

        </aside>

        For many years I have been working in banking field at different
        positions (from junior specialist to manager and a head of department)
        connected with product or process developing. And for several last years
        in fintech industry only. For now I’m working at the position of product
        owner of Bank BelVEB OJSC mobile banking app named “UP”. Having quite
        long experience in fintech I’m very interested in different app
        development (especially for iOS) and highly motivated to move to IT. I’m
        not sure if I want to be a programmer for all my life. Very likely I
        would become RM or PM or even get back to PO in future but for now I
        really interested in programming process and want to try it as a real
        programmer. To say the truth I had these intensions for many years but
        wasn’t sure if i would be interesting as an employee for IT-company
        being 34-years old (for now). But my latest experienced in fintech made
        me to change my mind.
